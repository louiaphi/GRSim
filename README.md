###### (500x500), M = 80, a = 60(wayyy to much), z = 0(obvious), Rim = 700(singularity infinitly thin, makes sing bigger)
<!-- Yes, my only Markdown skills are spamming #, and I googled how to do "hidden Text" in Md... -->
#### Legend:
* Darker: Less deviation
* Lighter: More deviation
* Red: Ring Singularity
* Pink: Non Singularity that works as a singularity when working with H, need to switch to Kretschmann Scalar for this to be no singular. Very interesting stuff happening here in reality
