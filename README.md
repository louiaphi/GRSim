###### (500x500), M = 80, a = 60(wayyy to much), z = 0(obvious), Rim = 700(singularity infinitly thin, makes sing bigger),
###### (500x500), M = 8, a = 4.5, z = 0, Rim = 300 (more realistic)

#### Legend:
* Darker: Less deviation
* Lighter: More deviation
* Red: Ring Singularity
* Blue: Ergosphere
* Lila/ later Pink: Non Singularity that works as a singularity when working with H, need to switch to Kretschmann Scalar for this to be no singular. Very interesting stuff happening here in reality
